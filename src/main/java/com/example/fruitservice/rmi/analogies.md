## 🤖 Analogy: What `Compute.java` Really Does

### 🪄 Imagine a Magic Robot Helper

Let’s pretend you have a **magic robot in your kitchen**. You can ask it to do things with fruits, like:

- 🍎 Add a new fruit and its price  
- 💰 Change the price of a fruit  
- ❌ Remove a fruit  
- 🧮 Tell you how much it would cost to buy some fruits  
- 🧾 Print a receipt for your shopping

But… you **can’t talk to the robot directly**.

Instead, you write your request on a **piece of paper**. This paper is called a **`Task`**. Then, you drop the paper into a **special mailbox**.

---

### 🧠 What Does `Compute.java` Do?

The `Compute` interface is like the **robot’s instruction manual**.  
It tells the robot:

> “Whenever you get a piece of paper (a `Task`), read it, do what it says, and then give back the answer.”

It **doesn’t care** what’s written on the paper — it could be:
- "Add an apple for 50 coins"
- "How much for 3 bananas?"

The robot just reads the paper, does the job, and gives you the result.

---

### 🧵 In Simple Words

1. 📝 You write a request (a `Task`)
2. 🤖 The robot (RMI server) reads it using `Compute`
3. ✅ The robot executes the job
4. 📤 You receive the result

---

### 🧾 TL;DR: What `Compute.java` Means

> “Hey robot, whenever you get a `Task`, **execute it and return the result!**”

## 🧩 Analogy: What `Task.java` Really Does

### 🧠 The Robot and the Special Cards

Remember our magic robot in the kitchen?  
You want the robot to do different jobs with fruits, like:

- Adding a fruit  
- Changing a price  
- Making a receipt

But the robot can’t just listen to your voice.  
You must write your job on a **special card** and give it to the robot.

---

### 📄 What is `Task.java`?

`Task.java` is the **rule for making those special cards**.

It says:

> “Every card must have a way to tell the robot what job to do and how to do it.”

> “Every card must have a little box called `execute()`.”

When the robot gets a card, it opens the box and finds out what job to do.

---

### 📦 In Simple Words

- You write a job on a card (like “Add apple for 50 coins”).
- The card follows the rules from `Task.java`.
- It **must have** a way for the robot to read and do the job (`execute()`).
- The robot takes the card, opens the `execute()` box, and follows the instructions.

---

### 🧠 Why Is This Important?

If every card follows the same rule,  
then the robot can do **ANY job** you ask —  
as long as the card has the magic `execute()` box!

---

### ✨ Super Simple Example

- ✅ Want to add a fruit?  
  → Make an `AddFruitCard` that says “Add apple for 50 coins” and has an `execute()` box.

- ✅ Want a receipt?  
  → Make a `ReceiptCard` that says “Make a receipt for 5 apples” and has an `execute()` box.

Both cards follow the rule from `Task.java`,  
so the robot always knows what to do.

---

### 🧾 TL;DR: What `Task.java` Means

> “Every job card for the robot must have an `execute()` box,  
> so the robot knows what to do!”
